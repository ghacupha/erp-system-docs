Milestones
==========

Achievement of the various intended goals is tracked by names of old time characters
that I find interesting and whose life stories could be inspiring to someone. The lower
level designation serves to show atomic changes in the code while maintaining
compatibility between the server and client, which will inevitably have containers of
different versions, and exist in different repos.

This plan allows flexibility in fixing client issues without having to change server
versions, and also flexibility to work on either at chosen blocks of time and changing
the other only when the said compatibility is impaired.
